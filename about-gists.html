<h2>About gists</h2>

<div class="article-body content-body wikistyle markdown-format">
      

<div class="intro">

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com">Gists</a> are a great way to share your work. You can share single files, parts of files, or full applications.</p>

</div>

<p>Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked, cloned, and manipulated in every way.</p>

<h3>
<a name="types-of-gists" class="anchor" href="#types-of-gists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Types of gists</h3>

<p>There are two types of gists: <em>public gists</em> and <em>secret gists</em>. Additionally, if you are not logged into GitHub when you create your gist, it will be an <em>anonymous gist</em>. For steps on creating gists, see "<a href="/articles/creating-gists">Creating gists</a>".</p>

<h4>
<a name="public-gists" class="anchor" href="#public-gists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Public gists</h4>

<p>Public gists show up in <a href="https://gist.github.com/discover">Discover</a>, where people can browse new gists as they're created. They're also searchable, so you can use them if you'd like other people to find and see your work.</p>

<h4>
<a name="secret-gists" class="anchor" href="#secret-gists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Secret gists</h4>

<p>Secret gists don't show up in Discover and are not searchable. Use them to jot down an idea that came to you in a dream, create a to-do list, or prepare some code or prose that's not ready to be shared with the world.</p>

<p>Secret gists don't count as private repositories. You can create as many secret gists as you like, even if you have a free GitHub account. </p>

<div class="alert warning">

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist. If you need to keep your code away from prying eyes, you may want to <a href="/articles/creating-a-new-repository">create a private repository</a> instead.</p>

</div>

<h4>
<a name="anonymous-gists" class="anchor" href="#anonymous-gists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Anonymous gists</h4>

<p>If you create a gist without logging into GitHub, it will be an anonymous gist. Anonymous gists can be public or secret. To delete an anonymous gist on GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise, contact <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub support</a> or your site administrator, respectively. Please provide the URL of the gist you wish to delete.</p>

<p>You can discover gists others have created by going to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist home page</a> and clicking <strong>All Gists</strong>. This will take you to a page of all gists sorted and displayed by time of creation or update. You can also search gists by language with <a href="https://gist.github.com/search">Gist Search</a>. Gist search uses the same search syntax as <a href="/articles/searching-code">code search</a>.</p>
